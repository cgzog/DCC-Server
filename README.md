# DCC-Server
Arduino-based UDP DCC Signal Generator


An Arduino-based project to generate DCC timing signals from network sourced DCC packets

The intent is to enable a total software-based command station which can generate DCC packets
and use an Arduino-based device to generate a properly timed DCC signal to drive a DCC booster
(or potentially drive a modest DCC load directly).
The hope is to enable the rapid development and enhancement of a 100% software DCC ocmmand station
rather than being tied to the development and release cycles of the hardware-based DCC vendors.
